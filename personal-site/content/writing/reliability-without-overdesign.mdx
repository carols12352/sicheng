title: Reliability Without Overdesign
date: 2026-01-29
summary: Reliability work should target observed failure modes, not theoretical architecture ideals.
---

## Starting Point
Many systems fail because reliability is added too late or added as a heavy abstraction layer that is never fully understood.

## Approach
I start with instrumentation and explicit error paths in v1. In v2, I add idempotency and retries where production data justifies it. In v3, I formalize runbooks and load boundaries.

## What This Avoids、
here are some common pitfalls of overdesigning for reliability:
- Premature platform complexity.
- Hidden behavior in generic wrappers.
- Operational surprise during incidents.

## Outcome
Reliability improves in steps, and each step is tied to concrete evidence from production behavior.
