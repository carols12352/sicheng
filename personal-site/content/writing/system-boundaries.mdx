title: System Boundaries Before Framework Choices
date: 2026-02-15
summary: Defining service boundaries early reduces accidental coupling and simplifies long-term scaling.

## Context
In early versions of a system, it is easy to optimize for speed of coding and delay boundary decisions. This often creates hidden coupling that becomes expensive during growth.

## Core Decision
I define boundaries around ownership of data and failure handling, not around team preferences or framework conventions.

## Trade-Offs
here are trade-offs to consider when defining boundaries:
- Strong boundaries add short-term friction during feature delivery.
- Weak boundaries look fast early but increase migration cost later.

## Practical Result
When ownership is explicit, service evolution from v1 to v3 can happen incrementally without large rewrites.
