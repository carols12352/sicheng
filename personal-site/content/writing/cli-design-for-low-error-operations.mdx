## Goal
I design CLI tools for predictable behavior, not clever interfaces.

## Principles

1. Every mutating command has a dry-run mode.
2. Output is structured and stable enough for scripts.
3. Validation happens before side effects.
4. Errors are explicit and mapped to actionable fixes.

## Example Pattern
For bookkeeping-style operations, a command should confirm what it parsed and what it will write before writing anything.

## Outcome
The tool becomes safer for daily use and easier to integrate into CI or scheduled tasks.
