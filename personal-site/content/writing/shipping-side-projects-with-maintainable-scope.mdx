title: Shipping Side Projects With Maintainable Scope
date: 2026-02-10
summary: Most side projects fail from uncontrolled scope. I keep momentum by constraining architecture and release shape.

## Scope Discipline
I define one production path first:

1. Auth path.
2. Core data flow.
3. One visible user outcome.

Everything else is optional until this path is stable.

## Architecture Rule
I avoid early abstraction layers. Instead, I keep modules simple and split them only after repeated pressure from real usage.

## Release Rule
Ship in small steps:

- v1: usable baseline.
- v2: reliability and observability.
- v3: cleanup and extension points.

## Why It Matters
This approach keeps projects shippable while still leaving room for long-term evolution.
